# MIDAS-IIITD-Task

### Development environment

*Install with conda*

```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

*Run JupyterLab*
   
```
jupyter-lab
```

*Use Jupyter Notebook*

```
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
```

### NLP Task

Use given dataset to build a model to predict the category using description. Write code in python. Using Jupyter notebook is encouraged. 
Clean this data, In the product category tree separate all the categories, figure out the primary category, and then use the model to predict this.
If you want to remove some categories for lack of data, you are also free to do that, mention this with explanation and some visualization.

- Show how you would clean and process the data
- Show how you would visualize this data
- Show how you would measure the accuracy of the model
- What ideas do you have to improve the accuracy of the model? What other algorithms would you try?

**Deliverables-**
1) Goal is to predict the product category.
2) Description should be the main feature. Feel free to use other features if it'd improve the model.
3) Include a Readme.pdf file with approach in detail and report the accuracy and what models were used.
